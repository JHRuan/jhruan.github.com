# This is my first blog page!

#### My purpose of running this blog is to record the problems I met and the solutions to them during my daily work.
#### My research field is Power Electronics, so the blogs I post on here are mainly about Power Electronics.
#### And I will be very glad if the experiences I put up on here can help you :)
